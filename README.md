== Simple Geyser Vote Listener ==
6/16/2020 - v0.1 - LEOcab

I made this plugin for Geyser users who need their Bedrock players to be able
to vote. By default, voting sites don't register votes for players with an
asterisk in their name or presumably other characters.  Run the plugin once
to generate the config, then change the geyser-prefix option to whatever your
prefix is set to on Geyser. The rest should be self-explanatory.

*** VERY IMPORTANT ***
Tell your Bedrock players to *NOT* include their Geyser prefix in their name
when on the voting sites!!
